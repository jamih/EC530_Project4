### Description

This project integrates conversion of audio files to text into a queue system.
In the repo, there is an audio file in which a person says "I believe you're just talking nonsense."


### Steps

Run the following code blocks in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/jamih/EC530_Project4.git
```

```
pip install requirements
```

```
python speech_text_queue.py
```

### Screenshots 
Below is a screenshot showing the terminal output when the queue system is running.

As you can see, the queue systems makes it so that both audio files are read first, then there are two prompts for speech to text that follow. The speech to text system successfully transcribed my phrases "hello there" and "I am hungry".
